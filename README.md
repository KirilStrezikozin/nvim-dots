# Old nvim-dots

The older version of my nvim configuration. Quite minimal and mostly uses only the following plugins:

- [lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim)
- [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim)
- [cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp)
- [harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon)
- [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)

## Inspiration

Inspired by no one, I've set this all up myself.

## Further exploration
